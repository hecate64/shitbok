An implementation of a shitbok interpreter using https://github.com/pocmo/Python-Brainfuck

Usage:
 ./shitbok.py yourcode.sb

'''
shitshitshit = increases memory pointer, or moves the pointer to the right 1 block.
shitshitbok  = decreases memory pointer, or moves the pointer to the left 1 block.
shitbokshit  = increases value stored at the block pointed to by the memory pointer
shitbokbok   = decreases value stored at the block pointed to by the memory pointer
bokshitshit  = like c while(cur_block_value != 0) loop.
bokshitbok   = if block currently pointed to's value is not zero, jump back to bokshitshit
bokbokshit   = like c getchar(). input 1 character.
bokbokbok    = like c putchar(). print 1 character to the console

During my internship, my advisor told me a story about his son using the word 'shit' and the turkish word of 'shit' together.
He also told me that the two combination can chained more than once.
At that point, I knew 'shit' and 'bok' can be turing complete.
